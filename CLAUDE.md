See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the working contract and
[docs/invariants.md](docs/invariants.md) for rules the code cannot state itself.

## Quick Reference

# The catalog API (catalog/, its own project): `make help` lists the rest

```

`docker compose up -d` is the production path and reads its configuration from
the deploying shell, not from a file on the host — deploy through the workflow
rather than running it by hand. See
[docs/deployment/](docs/deployment/).

Structure is not documented here on purpose — it drifts. Read `app/` directly.
