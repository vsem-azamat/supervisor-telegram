"""List the group chats an account is in, arranged by its Telegram folders.

The step before handing administration over: knowing which chats are in scope.
The account that owns them has them sorted into folders already — universities,
dormitories, and so on — and that sorting is a better description of scope than
anything this repository could infer, so it is read rather than guessed at.

    uv run python scripts/tg_chats.py folders --account main
    uv run python scripts/tg_chats.py candidates --account main --folder студ --bot @konnekt_moder_bot

`folders` shows what folders exist and how many groups are in each. `candidates`
lists the groups themselves, with whether this account can appoint admins there
and, when a bot is named, whether that bot is present.

Private conversations are never touched
---------------------------------------
This reads a chat list, not chats. Groups and supergroups are the only thing it
keeps: a peer that is a user is dropped at the point it is read, before it is
looked up, printed or counted. Nothing here calls any method that returns
message contents — the whole file has no way to fetch a message, which is a
stronger guarantee than a rule about not printing them.

What it reports per chat is what an administrator sees in the chat's own
settings: title, id, member count, and who holds which rights.
