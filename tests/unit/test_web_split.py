"""The public half of the web must stay public.

The web is one Mini App in `web/`: its console is `web/src/console/`, and
everything else is the public half. A directory is exactly the kind of
convention that erodes: somebody
needs a member count on a public screen, reaches for the endpoint that already
returns one, and a page anybody can open starts asking for an admin session.
Nothing in the type system notices.

So the boundary is asserted here instead. These read the sources as text on
purpose — what needs checking is which imports and which URLs appear, which the
text answers exactly.
