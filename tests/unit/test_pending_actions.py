"""Destructive actions proposed from outside wait for a human press.

The point of contrast with EscalationService is expiry. An escalation that runs
out of time carries out its default action, because the bot already judged
something wrong and was only asking for a second opinion. A pending action that
runs out of time must do nothing at all: it came from a token, and silence
there has to mean no.
