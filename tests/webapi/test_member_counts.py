"""Member counts, read from what was recorded rather than asked of Telegram.

The console showed a dash for every chat, and had since the counts were added:
they were fetched through a Telethon client this process never has. The rows to
answer from were being written all along — except they were not, because the
loop writing them was started from this process too. Both halves of that are
fixed elsewhere; what is pinned here is the read.
