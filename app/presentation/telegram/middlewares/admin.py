"""Two guards, told apart by how far a mistake travels.

:class:`AdminMiddleware` covers commands that spoil one chat — a ban, a mute, a
deleted message. Whoever moderates that chat may run them, and nowhere else.

:class:`SuperAdminMiddleware` covers commands that spoil all forty-five at once:
the shared blacklist, handing out moderator rights, a link into the web console.
Those stay with the accounts named in ``ADMIN_SUPER_ADMINS``, which lives in
configuration rather than the database, so the set of people who can grant power
cannot be changed by writing a row.

Neither guard consults Telegram's own list of chat administrators. That crown
gets handed out so a name appears in the member list.
