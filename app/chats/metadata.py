"""What Telegram will tell the bot about a chat.

All of it over the Bot API. The moderator bot is an administrator in every
managed chat, which is enough for the title, the photo and the member count —
none of these ever needed the client API, and depending on it was how the
counts came to be empty: that account's session lives on one developer's
machine, so in production there was nothing to ask.

Two calls, because Telegram splits them: `getChat` carries the title and photo,
`getChatMemberCount` carries the number.
