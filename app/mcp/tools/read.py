"""Read-only moderation tools for the MCP control plane.

These began as the read tools of an in-process assistant that has since been
removed, and three things changed on the way out.

*Structured output.* The old tools returned prose because their only consumer
was a prompt. Here the consumer is an external runtime, so every tool returns an
explicit projection: named fields, no ORM rows, nothing that changes shape when
a column is added.

*Explicit gates.* Every tool that names a chat resolves it through
:func:`~app.mcp.deps.managed_chat_id` first, so a chat this deployment does not
manage has no id to hand on.

*Withheld fields.* A projection is also the place to decide what never leaves —
see the free-text rationale on past moderation decisions, below.

Everything here reads either our own tables or the Bot API. These tools used to
reach through a user session that could see every chat the account belonged to,
private conversations included; the gate above existed mostly to contain that.
What they can see now is bounded by what the bot was in the room for.
